# PollEvClicker Threaded
this code is written for a specific type of poll used by my professors at the university. The code is based on the Selenium module and the Xpath code of the buttons. 
In this version I managed to run multiple bots on the PollEv.
Dont have to high expectations, its my first "real" project here on GitHub. 

# Personal Project

added parallel execution aka threading

Learning how to work with selenium and Xpath.
recently added a method to run the code multiple times.
