# PollEvClickerThreat
this code is written for a specified type of poll used by my professors at the university. The code is based on the Selenium module and the Xpath code of the buttons. 
In this version I managed to run multiple bots on the PollEv.
Dont have to high expectations, its my first real project here on GitHub. 

# Personal Project
added parallel execution

Learning how to work with selenium and Xpath.
recently added a method to run the code multiple times.

# Want your custom PollevBot please contact me and we'll see if I can help you.
